In this file, there are 28 .xlsx files and 1 .ipynb file contains. 
The .xlsx files changed and nontable parts have been cut. So they are different from the original tables. 
    The .xlsx files have 2 common forms:
        1. there is 1 table which is the registration and voting numbers (in thousands)
        2. There are 2 tables, first one is the registration and voting numbers (in thousands). The second one is Margins of Error for Estimates.
    Also, There are multiple heads and multiple columns for index. But the heads and the indexes have converted to single head or index so the names of them long
    The df. name gives information about the table.-> census_data_table_1.name='by Sex and Single Years of Age'
